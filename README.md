A simple chatting application developed with Firebase. Firebase Realtime Database is used for storing messages, Firebase Storage is used for storing photo messages, Firebase Authentication is used for letting only the authenticated users use the app. This is my first application with Firebase so the personal messages feature is not implemented. So basically this is a group chat application.
