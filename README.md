# Yatter

A simple chatting application developed with Firebase. Firebase Realtime Database is used for storing messages, Firebase Storage is used for storing photo messages, Firebase Authentication is used for letting only the authenticated users use the app. This is my first application with Firebase so the personal messages feature is not implemented. So basically this is a group chatting application.

The minimum API Level of the app is 21 which means that only AVDs or Android Devices with API Level 21 or above or Android Version 5.0 or above will support the app.


## How to install the app in your android device?
* [app-debug.apk](https://github.com/jayesh-srivastava/Yatter-android/blob/master/app-debug.apk)\
Click on the above link and click on 'view raw'. You might have to grant some initial permissions to install an app from an unknown source. Install and open.
